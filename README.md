# nibbins

A simple, fast, full-stack product search application built with FastAPI, HTMX, and Elasticsearch.

This project demonstrates a modern, minimal web app that avoids a heavy frontend by leveraging server-side rendering with HTMX and fullâ€‘text search via Elasticsearch.

## Technology Stack

- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Frontend: HTMX with Jinja2 templates
- Search: Elasticsearch (single-node in Docker)
- Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
- Data Population: Python scraper using `requests` and Elasticsearch bulk indexing

## How to Run the Application

1. Start the services:
   This command builds the images and starts the FastAPI backend and Elasticsearch.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. Populate the index:
   This command runs the scraper to fetch sample product data and index it into Elasticsearch. You only need to run this once (re-run to refresh data).

   ```bash
   docker-compose run --rm scraper
   ```

3. Access the application:
   Open your browser at:
   http://localhost:8000

   Type in the search bar to see live results.

## Configuration

- Environment:
  - `ELASTICSEARCH_URL` (default `http://es:9200` in Docker, `http://localhost:9200` locally)
  - `ES_INDEX` (default `products`)

## Future Implementation Plans

This prototype can be extended with several features:

- Improved Search Experience:
  - Pagination for large result sets
  - Sorting (price, relevance)
  - Filtering (e.g., by category)

- Enhanced Scraper:
  - Multiple data sources
  - Better error handling and logging
  - Scheduling for freshness
  - Incremental updates and deduplication

- Production-Ready Deployment:
  - Reverse proxy (Traefik/Nginx) and SSL
  - Elasticsearch scaling if data/traffic demands
  - Robust deployment strategy (e.g., Kubernetes) if needed

- User Features:
  - Authentication
  - Saved searches and favorites
